## CONTENT and DATA

Hi! In this project, I designed a website about Rick and Morty. I used API for data. (ref: [website](https://rickandmortyapi.com/))

#

## PAGES 

It is a website consisting of 5 pages. 

#### - Home Page
#### - Characters Page
#### - Locations Page
#### - Episodes Page
#### - Favorite Char Page

#

Also, there is a sixth page if you try to access a site that doesn't exist.

#### - Not Found Page

#

## DEVELOPMENT

Here are some of the tools I use

#### - Axios for fetch
#### - React Hooks for data & state management
#### - SCSS for styling
#### - i18next & i18n-react for multi-language (EN | TR)

#

## DEPLOYMENT

### - Netlify

I preferred Netlify for the deployment phase. You can access it via this [link](https://rick-and-morty-wiki-website.netlify.app/).

### - Localhost

If you want to run this site in your local, you can clone the project. After that, you can simply follow the steps below in your terminal.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

When you get the notification which shows that the terminal is running successfully, the browser will most likely open automatically the website. But if it doesn't, you can go to the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
